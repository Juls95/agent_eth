**Phase 1: Environment Setup**

1.  Verify that Node.js is installed by running `node -v` in your terminal (confirm that you are using a stable Node.js version as per best practices; see PRD Section 6. Non-Functional Requirements for performance standards).

2.  Install TypeScript globally by executing `npm install -g typescript` (this ensures strong typing per PRD Section 5, Tech Stack & Tools) and verify installation with `tsc -v`.

3.  Initialize a new Git repository at the project root and create `main` and `dev` branches (refer to PRD Section 7, Constraints & Assumptions regarding standardized development workflows).

4.  Create the following directory structure:

    *   `/frontend` for the React.js based dashboard
    *   `/backend` for Node.js services, monitoring agent, and API endpoints
    *   `/infra` for deployment configuration (see File Structure Document in the project outline for guidance).

5.  **Validation**: Run `git status` to ensure the repository is correctly initialized and both branches exist.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development**

1.  Initialize a React project with TypeScript in the `/frontend` directory using a command like `npx create-react-app . --template typescript` (see PRD Section 5: Tech Stack & Tools: Frontend).

2.  Integrate V0 by Vercel for AI-powered component building. Create a sample component at `/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` that renders a placeholder for real-time Uniswap metrics (refer to App Flow: Main Dashboard).

3.  Create additional UI components:

    *   `/frontend/src/components/Login.tsx` for sign-in/sign-up (refer to App Flow: Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up)
    *   `/frontend/src/components/AlertSettings.tsx` for managing alert thresholds
    *   `/frontend/src/components/HistoricalTrends.tsx` for displaying historical data (see PRD Section 3: User Flow).

4.  Implement routing in the frontend by setting up React Router in `/frontend/src/App.tsx` to navigate between Dashboard, Login, Alert Settings, and Historical Trends pages (refer to App Flow: Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions).

5.  **Validation**: Run `npm start` in the `/frontend` directory and verify that navigating between pages (Dashboard, Login, Alert Settings, Historical Trends) works as intended.

**Phase 3: Backend Development**

1.  In the `/backend` directory, initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript by running `npm init -y` followed by `npm install typescript ts-node @types/node` (see PRD Section 5: Tech Stack & Tools: Backend).
2.  Configure TypeScript by creating a `tsconfig.json` file in `/backend` with settings suited for Node.js development (refer to Backend Structure Document for guidelines).
3.  Install and set up the Warden Protocol Agent Kit in `/backend` (follow the kit’s installation instructions and reference PRD Section 1: Project Overview for monitoring agent purpose). Create a file `/backend/src/agent.ts` to initialize and run the monitoring agent.
4.  For blockchain interactions, install Web3.js or Ethers.js (choose one; for this plan we use Ethers.js) by running `npm install ethers` in `/backend`. Create `/backend/src/blockchain.ts` to handle interactions with Uniswap smart contracts (refer to PRD Section 5: Tech Stack & Tools: Blockchain Interaction).
5.  Develop an API endpoint for alert configuration and retrieval. Create a file `/backend/src/api/alerts.ts` that exports a POST endpoint `/api/alerts` to receive alert settings from users and a GET endpoint `/api/alerts` to retrieve current settings (refer to PRD Section 3: User Flow and PRD Section 4: Core Features).
6.  Implement email/SMS alert functionality by installing necessary API libraries (e.g., for email use nodemailer or similar, and for SMS integrate a service like Twilio). Create `/backend/src/alertsService.ts` to manage sending notifications when detection algorithms trigger alerts (see PRD Section 4: Core Features).
7.  **Validation**: Test the blockchain integration by calling functions in `/backend/src/blockchain.ts` using a script (e.g., run `ts-node /backend/src/blockchain.ts`) to confirm connection to Uniswap contracts; test API endpoints using `curl` or Postman (e.g., `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/alerts` and verify a 200 response).

**Phase 4: Integration**

1.  In the `/frontend/src/services` directory, create a file `api.ts` that uses `axios` to call backend endpoints (e.g., alert configuration). Ensure that the POST request from `/frontend/src/components/AlertSettings.tsx` targets the endpoint `http://localhost:3000/api/alerts` (refer to App Flow and PRD Section 3: User Flow).
2.  Integrate real-time data updates by establishing a WebSocket or polling mechanism in `/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` that fetches live data from the monitoring agent provided by `/backend/src/agent.ts` (refer to App Flow: Main Dashboard).
3.  Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the backend. In `/backend/src/server.ts` (create this file as the main entry point), add middleware to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` (see PRD Section 6: Non-Functional Requirements and Backend Structure Documentation).
4.  **Validation**: Run the full stack locally (start both backend and frontend services) and confirm that the dashboard correctly displays real-time metrics and that alert settings updates are properly stored and trigger notifications.

**Phase 5: Deployment**

1.  Create a deployment configuration file `/infra/aws/deployment.yaml` for deploying the backend to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk or similar service) as advised by PRD Section 6: Non-Functional Requirements regarding scalability.
2.  Configure the frontend build for deployment by adding a build script in `/frontend/package.json` and then deploy the built assets to Vercel using V0 by Vercel’s deployment tools (refer to PRD Section 5: Tech Stack & Tools: Frontend and Deployment guidelines).
3.  Set up cloud-based data storage by configuring Amazon DynamoDB or Supabase. Create configuration files in `/infra/database/` detailing connection parameters and backup strategies (refer to PRD Section 5: Tech Stack & Tools: Data Storage).
4.  **Validation**: Deploy both frontend and backend to staging environments and run end-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress) to ensure that API endpoints, real-time data feeds, and alerting systems function correctly under deployed conditions.

**Phase 6: Post-Launch**

1.  Monitor system performance by integrating logging and monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch for backend, Vercel analytics for frontend) as described in PRD Section 6: Non-Functional Requirements.
2.  Schedule daily backups for your cloud database (DynamoDB/Supabase) by setting up a cron job that runs `pg_dump` or an equivalent backup command, configured within `/infra/database/backup.yaml` (refer to PRD Section 7: Constraints & Assumptions).
3.  Implement a fallback and retry mechanism in `/backend/src/alertsService.ts` to ensure that failed email/SMS notifications are reattempted (refer to Known Issues in PRD Section 8).
4.  **Validation**: Simulate high-load scenarios using a tool like Locust or a similar load-testing framework to ensure the system maintains performance targets (verify error rates and response times as specified in PRD Section 6: Non-Functional Requirements).
5.  Document and set up a process for regular updates using the integrated AI coding assistance tools (Claude AI and Cursor) to ensure continuous improvement and responsiveness to new market conditions (refer to Additional Context in the project description).
