# Introduction

A well-organized file structure is the backbone of the project, making it easier for everyone to understand, maintain, and add new features without losing track. By setting up a clear organization of files right from the start, developers, designers, and management alike will benefit from a cohesive workspace that ensures consistency and smooth collaboration. This project is focused on creating a DeFi monitoring tool that uses the Warden Protocol Agent Kit to track trading volume and liquidity on Uniswap, making structured file organization crucial for both backend processing and a user-friendly dashboard.

# Overview of the Tech Stack

This project makes use of several modern and powerful tools. The core programming language is TypeScript, which provides improved code safety and readability. The backend is powered by Node.js for efficient data processing, while real-time blockchain data is handled via Web3.js or Ethers.js. The front-end dashboard is created using React.js, making it both interactive and responsive. To build some parts of the interface, V0 by Vercel is used, while assistant tools like Claude AI and Cursor ensure that coding is as efficient and smart as possible. Furthermore, data storage is achieved using a cloud solution, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Supabase, which helps with scalability and reliability. Each element of the tech stack influences the file structure, ensuring that both functionality and organization are clear and segregated by responsibility.

# Root Directory Structure

At the root of the project, you will find several key directories that anchor the overall organization. A main directory, often labeled as 'src', holds the primary source code, which is further split into subdirectories for the front-end and back-end components. For instance, a 'frontend' folder contains all the React.js components, styles, and assets for the dashboard, whereas a 'backend' folder contains the core monitoring agent built with Node.js and TypeScript. There is also a 'config' folder that holds critical configuration files, an 'env' file for environment variables, and a 'docs' directory where documentation is stored. Additionally, important files such as README.md for project overview, package.json and tsconfig.json for dependency and TypeScript configurations, and .gitignore for version control, are located at the root level to help manage the application holistically.

# Configuration and Environment Files

The project relies on several configuration files to ensure everything runs smoothly and consistently. The .env file, stored safely in the 'config' directory or at the root, includes environment variables for sensitive information like API keys, databases, and blockchain node URLs. Files such as package.json, tsconfig.json, and Webpack or Vercel configuration files are all present to guide the building, dependency management, and deployment of the project. Each of these files plays a vital role in making sure that when the project is run on any machine, it behaves exactly the same, thanks to these consistent setup parameters.

# Documentation Structure

Documentation is maintained in its own dedicated directory, ensuring that all the necessary guides, technical notes, and process descriptions are centralized in one place. This folder includes design documents, such as this file structure document, setup and installation guides for developers and users, and guidelines detailing how the code is organized and should be modified going forward. By keeping documentation separate but easily accessible, the team can consistently maintain quality assurance and share knowledge effectively. This approach supports both onboarding new team members and future scalability of the deployment process.

# Conclusion and Overall Summary

In summary, this projectâ€™s file structure plays an essential role in ensuring robust development, efficient collaboration, and easy maintenance. By clearly separating the front-end, back-end, configuration, and documentation, every team member knows where to find relevant code and information. Special attention is given to ensuring that configuration files and environment variables are properly managed, which is crucial for a project that integrates blockchain data, real-time monitoring, and complex user interfaces. This organized file system, built on a mature tech stack including TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, and various blockchain tools, sets a strong foundation for both current development needs and future enhancements, making it a unique and powerful solution in the DeFi space.
