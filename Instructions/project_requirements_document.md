# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) monitoring agent built using the Warden Protocol Agent Kit. The tool is designed to continuously track real-time trading volume and liquidity metrics on Uniswap. Its primary purpose is to identify significant market moves and liquidity changes, so traders, investors, and market analysts can seize financial opportunities and make informed decisions. The tool leverages advanced detection algorithms and alert systems that notify users instantly when market conditions match predefined criteria.

The motivation behind building this project is to solve the challenge traders and investors face in managing overwhelming amounts of dynamic data on DeFi platforms. By offering a simple dashboard that presents up-to-date metrics, historical trends, and customizable alert options, the tool aims to deliver clarity and timely insights. Key objectives include ensuring data accuracy, delivering rapid notifications via email/SMS, and providing a user-friendly interface that enhances decision-making in competitive markets.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Real-time monitoring of Uniswap’s trading volume and liquidity metrics.
*   Detection algorithms that highlight significant market moves or unusual liquidity changes.
*   A web-based dashboard that displays current metrics and historical trends.
*   Customizable alert settings allowing users to define thresholds for notifications.
*   Integration with email/SMS APIs for immediate alert delivery.
*   Data storage solution using cloud databases such as Amazon DynamoDB or Supabase for historical data.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Monitoring or support for DeFi protocols other than Uniswap in this first version.
*   Integration with external DeFi tools or platforms beyond what is required for Uniswap monitoring.
*   Advanced user account management features beyond basic login and settings.
*   Mobile app development or push notifications not via email/SMS.
*   Deep integration of advanced machine learning features beyond the initial use of GPT-4o for future predictive analysis explorations.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey starts when a trader, investor, or market analyst logs into the dashboard using it's wallet or connection method from Warden Agent Kit. Upon successful authentication, the user lands on a home page that provides a live overview of current Uniswap market metrics through visually engaging charts and graphs. From there, the user can navigate to various sections of the application to view detailed historical data, set up or modify alert preferences, and inspect the performance trends of liquidity and volume over time.

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and streamlined. After reviewing the overview, users can see the recommended trades or actions that the agent will take based on Claude Sonnet analysis and Smart Contract instructions. Once triggered, the system continuously monitors the market in the background and creates a new trade once these thresholds are surpassed. This guided journey ensures users can quickly access the information they need, while the consistent live data feed supports proactive trading and investment decisions.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **Real-Time Market Monitoring:**\
    Tracks Uniswap’s trading volume and liquidity continuously, providing up-to-the-minute data.
*   **Detection Algorithms:**\
    Implements algorithms (Claude Sonnet) to flag significant market moves or unusual liquidity events automatically.
*   **User Dashboard:**\
    A web-based interface built with React.js that visually displays live data, charts, and historical trends.
*   **Backend Data Processing:**\
    Utilizes Node.js to process data from the blockchain via ThGraph Uniswap integrations and manage detection logic.
*   **Cloud-Based Data Storage:**\
    Stores historical market data on Warden Blockchain.
*   **Predictive Analysis:**\
    Integration of advanced ML models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5) for predictive market insights.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   React.js for building a responsive and interactive user dashboard.
    *   V0 by Vercel as an AI-powered frontend component builder to ensure modern design patterns.

*   **Backend:**

    *   TypeScript for strong typing and enhanced code reliability across the entire project.

*   **Blockchain Interaction:**

    *   TheGraph API to get data from Uniswap.

*   **Monitoring & Protocol Integration:**

    *   Warden Protocol Agent Kit for creating and deploying the monitoring agent.

*   **Data Storage:**

    *   Warden Blockchain.

*   **AI and Code Assistance:**

    *   Claude AI for intelligent code assistance and real-time suggestions.
    *   Cursor IDE for AI-powered coding and productivity enhancements.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    The monitoring agent should process and display live market data with minimal latency (ideally within a few seconds of real-time changes). The backend should handle high volumes of requests without significant delays.
*   **Reliability & Scalability:**\
    The system should be able to scale with increasing data loads and user counts while ensuring consistency of alerts and historical data logging. High availability is critical, so architecture should support automatic recovery and load balancing.
*   **Usability:**\
    The dashboard should be intuitive with easy navigation, clear visuals, and simple customization options for alerts and data views.
*   **Compliance:**\
    Ensure that the project complies with relevant data protection standards and best practices concerning financial data management.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The first version is limited to monitoring the Uniswap protocol only.
    *   Real-time performance is dependent on the reliability and responsiveness of external APIs (e.g., blockchain nodes, email/SMS services).
    *   The overall system performance can be impacted by rate limits or restrictions imposed by the blockchain libraries used (Web3.js/Ethers.js) or the data storage service.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users will have a basic level of technical understanding of DeFi, trading, and market analytics.
    *   All third-party services and APIs (Warden Protocol Agent Kit, email/SMS APIs, cloud databases) will be available and reliable during operations.
    *   There is an expectation that improvements and enhancements (like advanced machine learning integration) may be added in future versions.
